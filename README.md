# 8 Key elements for Landing Pages from psychological & design perspective


Hi! Thanks for being here! Vineeta and I created this whitepaper as one of our projects for the Marketing Analyst course by WBS Code School.

As a marketer, we need to get through the maze of information everywhere and present it in the simplest forms of communication. It is vital to understand the psychology of people who use our services, obtain their data, and depict it most simplistically. In this whitepaper, 8 key elements have been described to consider while designing an **effective landing page** based on design principles and psychological concepts.

I hope you enjoy it and get many conversions on your Landing Page as possible.
